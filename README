Zora - Linux Panel Indicator for Colour Temperature Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Zora is a program that can adjust the colour temperature of your screen. It is
a command line tool for manual adjustment of the colour temperature (it applies
a redness effect to the graphical display). It allows to set the temperature
between 0K and 13000K, 6500K being the neutral temperature. There is only
support for the X Window System (which means that it does not work on Wayland).

Also, there is a graphical indicator applet which can adjust the colour
temperature from the notification area.
